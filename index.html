<p> HiGHS is high performance serial and parallel software for solving 
large-scale sparse linear programming (LP), mixed-integer programming
(MIP) and quadratic programming (QP) models, developed in C++11, with
interfaces to C, C#, FORTRAN, Julia and Python.</p>

<p> HiGHS is freely available under the MIT licence, and is downloaded
from <a href="https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS"
target="_blank">Github</a>. Installing HiGHS from source code requires
CMake minimum version 3.15, but no other third-party utilities. HiGHS
can be used as a stand-alone executable on Windows, Linux and MacOS. There is
a C++11 library which can be used within a C++ project or, via one of
the interfaces, to a project written in other languages.</p>

<p>Your comments or specific questions on HiGHS
would be greatly appreciated, so please send an email to
<a href="mailto:highsopt@gmail.com">highsopt@gmail.com</a> to get in
touch with the team.</p>

<p>HiGHS is based on the high performance dual revised simplex
implementation (HSOL) and its parallel variant (PAMI) developed by Qi
Huangfu. Features such as presolve, crash and advanced basis start
have been added by Julian Hall and Ivet Galabova. The QP solver and
original language interfaces were written by Michael Feldmeier. Leona
Gottwald wrote the MIP solver. The software engineering of HiGHS was
developed by Ivet Galabova.

<p>In the absence of a release paper, academic users of HiGHS are kindly requested to cite the following article</p>

<p>Parallelizing the dual revised simplex method, Q. Huangfu and J. A. J. Hall, <em>Mathematical Programming Computation</em>, <strong>10</strong> (1), 119-142, 2018. DOI: <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12532-017-0130-5" target="_blank">10.1007/s12532-017-0130-5</a></p>

<h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>

<p>Any linear optimization problem will have <strong>decision
variables</strong>, a linear or quadratic <strong>objective
function</strong>, and linear <strong>constraints</strong>
and <strong>bounds</strong> on the values of the decision
variables. A <strong>mixed-integer</strong> optimization problem will
require some or all of the decision variables to take integer
values. The problem may require the objective function to be maximized
or minimized whilst satisfying the constraints and bounds. By
default, HiGHS minimizes the objective function.</p>

<p>The bounds on a decision variable are the least and greatest values
that it may take, and infinite bounds can be specified. A linear
objective function is given by a set of coefficients, one for each
decision variable, and its value is the sum of products of
coefficients and values of decision variables. The objective
coefficients are often referred to as <strong>costs</strong>, and some
may be zero. When a problem has been solved, the optimal values of the
decision variables are referred to as the <strong>(primal)
solution</strong>.</p>

<p>Linear constraints require linear functions of decision variables
to lie between bounds, and infinite bounds can be specified. If the
bounds are equal, then the constraint is
an <strong>equation</strong>. If the bounds are both finite, then the
constraint is said to be <strong>boxed</strong>
or <strong>two-sided</strong>.</p>

<p>The coefficients of the linear constraints are naturally viewed as
rows of a <strong>matrix</strong>. The constraint coefficients
associated with a particular decision variable form a column of the
constraint matrix. Hence constraints are sometimes referred to
as <strong>rows</strong>, and decision variables
as <strong>columns</strong>. Constraint matrix coefficients may be
zero. Indeed, for large practical problems it is typical for most of
the coefficients to be zero. When this property can be exploited to
computational advantage, the matrix is said to
be <strong>sparse</strong>. When the constraint matrix is not sparse,
the solution of large problems is normally intractable
computationally.</p>

<p>It is possible to define a set of constraints and bounds that
cannot be satisfied, in which case the problem is said to
be <strong>infeasible</strong>. Conversely, it is possible that the
value of the objective function can be improved without bound whilst
satisfying the constraints and bounds, in which case the problem is
said to be <strong>unbounded</strong>. If a problem is neither
infeasible, nor unbounded, it has an <strong>optimal
solution</strong>. The optimal objective function value for a linear
optimization problem may be achieved at more than point, in which case
the optimal solution is said to be <strong>non-unique</strong>.</p>

<p>
When none of the decision variables is required to take integer
values, the problem is said to be <strong>continuous</strong>. For
continuous problems, each variable and constraint has an
associated <strong>dual variable</strong>. The values of the dual
variables constitute the <strong>dual solution</strong>, and it is for
this reason that the term <strong>primal solution</strong> is used to
distinguish the optimal values of the decision variables. At the
optimal solution of a continuous problem, some of the decision
variables and values of constraint functions will be equal to their
lower or upper bounds. Such a bound is said to
be <strong>active</strong>. If a variable or constraint is at a bound,
its corresponding dual solution value will generally be non-zero: when
at a lower bound the dual value will be non-negative; when at an upper
bound the dual value will be non-positive. When maximizing the
objective the required signs of the dual values are reversed. Due to
their economic interpretation, the dual values associated with
constraints are often referred to as <strong>shadow prices</strong>
or <strong>fair prices</strong>. Mathematically, the dual values
associated with variables are often referred to as <strong>reduced
costs</strong>, and the dual values associated with constraints are
often referred to as <strong>Lagrange multipliers</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Analysis of the change in optimal objective value of a continuous
linear optimization problem as the cost coefficients and bounds are
changed is referred to in HiGHS as <strong>ranging</strong>. For an
active bound, the corresponding dual value gives the change in the
objective if that bound is increased or decreased. This level of
analysis is often referred to as <strong>sensitivity</strong>. In
general, the change in the objective is only known for a limited range
of values for the active bound. HiGHS will return the limits of
these <strong>bound ranges</strong> ranges, the objective value at
both limits and the index of a variable or constraint that will
acquire an active bound at both limits. For each variable with an
active bound, the solution will remain optimal for a range of values
of its cost coefficient. HiGHS will return the values of
these <strong>cost ranges</strong>. For a variable or constraint whose
value is not at a bound, HiGHS will return the range of values that
the variable or constraint can take, the objective values at the
limits of the range, and the index of a variable or constraint with a
bound that will become in active at both limits.
